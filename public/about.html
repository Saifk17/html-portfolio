<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Saif, a passionate and dedicated web developer with a strong interest in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites. Currently exploring modern front-end technologies like React and Tailwind CSS, I enjoy turning ideas into digital experiences that are both functional and visually appealing.</p>

<p>My journey into web development began with a curiosity for how things work on the internet, which quickly grew into a focused learning path. I’m consistently working on improving my skills through real-world projects and challenges, aiming to contribute to the web in a meaningful way.</p>

<p>Beyond code, I’m driven by a strong desire to achieve financial freedom, make my parents proud, and create value through innovation. This website is part of that journey—a showcase of what I’m learning, building, and striving toward.</p>
